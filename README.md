# CS-255


- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  - The client is a attempting to build a program that will help prepare students for their driving test.
  - We decided on a web app with a cloud service provider serving their database and website to their users.

- What did you do particularly well?
  - I think that with the given information on the client and tehir requirements I was able to come up with a solid plan moving forward.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  - I think I would possibly reevaluate some of the UML diagrams there are a few corner cases that given the opportunity I would like to expand upon.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  - I tried to keep their requirements as light as possible.
  - If we tried to make their project too large in the first iteration we could potentially run the risk of making their project too expensive to maintatin and would cripple their business

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  - I think that the biggest issue that some people ignore is not thinking about the business when creating the plan.
  - For instance if we made the program too expensive to maintain for the customer then it could put too much strain on the company for them to survive.
